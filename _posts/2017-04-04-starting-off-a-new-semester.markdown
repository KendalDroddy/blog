It happened in a flash, but my short one week spring break has come to an end and my second semester at Oregon State has officially started. I'm enrolled in four courses:
* Computer Architecture and Assembly Language
* Introduction to Usability Engineering
* Data Structures
* Web Development

The semester has just started but I can already tell it will be packed full of interesting, new things to learn. I'm most excited about Web Development. Hopefully I will pick up some knowledge allowing me to expand and update this blog in a variety of ways. 

On top of this, I recently found out I was accepted to my first hackathon. I'll be attending HackDFW in Dallas toward the end of this month. While I'm nervous and unsure as to what to expect, I'm also quite excited! I know it will be a unique experience allowing me to learn new skills and also meet some great people who share my joy of programming.

Lastly but not least, I've started work on an iOS app. I've decided to use Swift to develop the app which is a slight problem...because I don't know Swift. However, I found a great course on Team Treehouse that I started a few weeks ago. It is fascinating to note the differences between Swift and C++ as I'm learning. To provide an example look at this code block:

{% highlight Swift %}
let country = "United States of America"
let state = "Oregon"

let interpolatedAddress = "\(country), \(state)"
{% endhighlight %}

There are no semicolons! During CS165 I'm sure I typed multiple thousands of those little punctuation marks. It is such a small thing, but not typing them feels so strange. I'm also much more aware of neat features included in Swift such as interpolation and dictionaries. In the example above I can create a string which includes variables in one simple statement. If I were to print it out `United States of America, Oregon` would display. I'm looking forward to learning more of what this language has to offer as I continue to work on my app!
