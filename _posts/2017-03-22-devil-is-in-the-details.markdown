I'm currently finishing up my first semester as a computer science student
at Oregon State University. The amount of content we covered was nearly 
overwhelming, but there are certainly some lessons I learned that stand out.
As I reflect over this past semester I hope to cover these lessons in my blog, 
beginning today!

Something I picked up very quickly is the fact that programming a computer is a
very precise science. Computers are incredibly powerful but they must be given
explicit instructions on how to carry out the tasks they perform. Even the slightest
mistake in spelling or syntax can cause dozens of errors to propogate when compiling.
This is exactly what happened to me on a recent assignment for my Introduction to
Programming course.
