As hectic as it has been these past few months, the spring term is coming to a close. It has definitely been the most challenging so far given the fact that I took four courses. I really hope that I won't have to do so again in the future. The sheer amount of material I covered in such a short time is just staggering. Hopefully, I can process everything a bit more over the summer and incorporate some of what I learned into my own personal projects.

Speaking of summer, I have decided to head North! Louisiana has always been and will always be home, but it is time for change. Shreveport is just slightly behind the curve when it comes to the tech sector. I'm hoping a move will bring about many more career and learning opportunities as that is what I really desire. I won't complain about leaving the sweltering heat and humidity behind either!

Notable Learning
================

I recently learned about hash maps in my data structures course and they are quite fascinating. This may be the most interesting structure that we've covered in class all term. This week's assignment required me to import words from a text file into a program. The program then hashed and stored the words into the map. One of the tests I ran required the program to hash every word found in the dictionary. It did so in just a few fractions of a second. I'm always astounded at how quickly computers can process data!
