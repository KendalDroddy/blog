Four years into a successful career in education I typed these words into Google: "Tech jobs for Liberal Arts majors." A world of opportunity appeared before my eyes as the results populated the screen.

Technology has always played a major role in my life, but until that Google search I had never considered a career in the field. However, just a few weeks after that fateful day, I was an enrolled member at Team Treehouse and programming constantly.

A few months passed and I enrolled in Harvard's CS50 course. My passion for the field continued to grow and I applied and was accepted into Oregon State University's computer science program. My goal is to learn as much as I'm able, earn my degree in CS, and become a successful software engineer.
